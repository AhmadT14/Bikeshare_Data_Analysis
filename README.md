# **Bikeshare Data Analysis 🚲📊**

As part of **Udacity's Data Science program**, I explored **US Bikeshare Data** to analyze trends in bike usage across major cities. This project enhanced my **Python** skills by working with real-world datasets.

## **Project Overview 📚**
This project involved analyzing bikeshare data from **Chicago, New York City, and Washington** to uncover patterns in ridership. The main objectives included:

- **Filtering and analyzing data** based on user input (city, month, and day).
- Extracting insights on **time statistics, station statistics, trip durations, and user demographics**.

## **Features 🛠️**
✅ **User Input Filters**: Select city, month, and day for customized analysis.  
✅ **Statistical Insights**:  
   - Most popular travel times.  
   - Most frequently used stations and trips.  
   - Total and average trip durations.  
   - User demographics (user type, gender, birth year).

## **Dataset Notice ⚠️**   
The `.csv` data files (`chicago.csv`, `new_york_city.csv`, `washington.csv`) used in this project are provided exclusively as part of Udacity's coursework.
